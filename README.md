# University Network Modeling Project

## Overview

This repository contains configurations and documentation for a university network model created using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project demonstrates inter-VLAN routing within a university campus network.

## Features

- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Demonstrates communication between different VLANs within the university network.
- **Network Topology**: Includes a sample network topology designed in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Configuration Files**: Provides configuration files for routers, switches, and VLANs.

## Usage

1. **Import Topology**: Open the provided Packet Tracer file (`university_network.pkt`) to view the network topology.

2. **Explore Configuration**: Examine the configurations of routers, switches, and VLANs within Packet Tracer.

3. **Test Inter-VLAN Communication**: Use Packet Tracer's simulation mode to test communication between devices in different VLANs.
